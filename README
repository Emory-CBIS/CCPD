CCPD:
Connectivity Change Point Detection (CCPD) is a fully automated two-stage approach which pools information across multiple subjects to estimate change points in functional connectivity, and subsequently estimates the brain networks within each
state phase lying between consecutive change points. The number and positioning of the change points are unknown and learned from the data in the first stage, by modeling a time-dependent connectivity metric under a fused lasso approach. In the second stage, the brain functional network for each state phase is inferred via sparse inverse covariance matrices. The step could be done through matlab function ‘CCPD’. 

[change_points,graph]=CCPD(Y,count)
Input:
%input:Y: 	Data set, format in T*V*Nsub
%                   T is number of time points, V is number of ROIs, Nsub
%                   is number of subjects
%      count: number of subsampling (default value 100)
%output: change_points: change points for all subjects
%        graph: graph of each bin, format in P*P*Nbin. The max value of Nbin is 20


CCPD_single
We have also extend the proposed CCPD approach for inferring subject level change points, which does not assume a similar locations of change points across subjects. The change points for each single subject and corresponding graphs could be estimated using matlab function ‘CCPD_single’.

[change_points,graph]=CCPD_single(Y)
%input:Y: Data set, format in T*V*Nsub
%                   T is number of time points, V is number of ROIs, Nsub
%                   is number of subjects
%output: change_points: change points for each subjects. In the format of Nsub*20, 
			  where 20 is the max number of possible change points for 
			  each subject.
%        graph: graph of each bin for each subject, format in P*P*Nbin*Nsub.
			 The max value of Nbin is 20

QUIC:
QUIC is needed and you could install it by following the README file in the folder of QUIC.
